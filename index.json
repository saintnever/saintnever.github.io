Materials","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Interactive everyday things are essential for ubiquitous sensing and interaction. Replace existing things with battery-powered ‘smart’ things is not sustainable, since the large amount of batteries would introduce huge maintenance efforts and cause significant damage to the environment. So, I develop maintenance and battery free wireless sensing tags that can be easily deployed on existing everyday things. The sensor’s many hardware components (e.g. power source, RF oscillator) and functions (e.g. signal digitalization) are offloaded to a remote resource-abundant computer. The cost, size, and power consumption of such sensors are then minimized, which makes them suitable for ubiquitous deployment on existing infrastructure and objects.\nFigure 1. BitID sensors can be easily made (a), registered (b), and deployed (c) on a door to detect intrusion (d).\rIn BitID, I propose to modify commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) low-cost and passive UHF RFID tags to detect binary object states. By attaching shorting stubs to exposed antenna around the chip, the tag’s readability is modulated by the connection status of the shorting stubs. Users can easily make BitID sensors using everyday tools like copper tape and scissors. We deploy BitID sensors on six objects in a room to show its high scalability. The codes for the BitID sensing system is open sourced on GitHub. The RFID reader used in BitID can be expensive and is not widely available yet. So I look into opportunities to leverage more accessible computers (e.g. smart phone, smart ring) to power and compute for the resource-constrained sensors. In FlexTouch, conductive tapes are attached to the touch screen of a smart phone to enable large-scale sensing (e.g. Yoga mat for posture detection). In ThermalRing, I used a smart ring with a low-power thermal camera to recognize passive aluminum stickers for quick access.\nGo to Finger Wearables\nGo to Interconnection Techniques\n","date":1554076800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554076800,"objectID":"46fed2c10fa00807b4f71d2ff2584b69","permalink":"https://txzhang.info/project_bak/sensing/","publishdate":"2019-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project_bak/sensing/","section":"project_bak","summary":"I invent passive sensors that can be deployed in a DIY manner to detect object status and human behaviors.","tags":null,"title":"Sensing Tags","type":"project_bak"},{"authors":["__Tengxiang Zhang__","Xin Yi","Ruolin Wang","Yuntao Wang","Chun Yu","Yiqin Lu","Yuanchun Shi"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1543795200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543795200,"objectID":"3b9f5ed2f92f7cf199d45000050b3ac0","permalink":"https://txzhang.info/publication/taptopair18/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/taptopair18/","section":"publication","summary":"IMWUT 2018Tap-to-Pair pairs two wireless devices spontaneously with no modifications on either device.","tags":["interaction","wireless","sensing","IoT"],"title":"Tap-to-Pair: Associating Wireless Devices with Synchronous Tapping","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Finger wearables can support accessible and subtle gesture inputs. They are also close to the interacting object, which makes them ideal for resource sharing. However, finger wearables are challenging to design due to their size constrains. The small size further limits the available computing, I/O, and power resources on such computers.\nFigure 1. Users wrap the flexible ring band around the finger and align the magnetic connectors to wear the ring. I/O module are also connected with the main board and battery through the connectors. To overcome the constrains, I explored modular design for a smart ring (Figure 1). Instead of integrating various I/O functions into one piece of hardware, ModularRing uses switchable I/O modules for interaction. The novel wearing design allows the I/O module to be separated from the wireless MCU and battery. Users can then switch the I/O module based on needs, and combine multiple rings with different I/O modules to create advanced interfaces. For example, a ring with a microphone module and a ring with a speaker module can work together as an audio interface to make a call. ModularRing won Finalist of 2018 Global Innovation Competition and led to three patents.\nFigure 2. ThermalRing can recognize gestural inputs on flat surfaces and image passive tags by leveraging the heat radiated from hand. In ThermalRing, I proposed a novel I/O module-a low-power low-resolution thermal camera for gesture and tag inputs. ThermalRing analyzes the heat silhouette of the hand to recognize drawing gestures on flat surfaces. I also proposed ThermalTag, passive tags that can be easily made using materials with high heat reflectivity (e.g. copper tape). When covered by hand, ThermalTag reflects the heat radiated from the hand and thus can be imaged. This demonstrates how the on-body wearables can work together with off-body tags for more interaction possibilities.\nGo to Sensing Tags\nGo to Interconnection Techniques\n","date":1524787200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524787200,"objectID":"021eef4ba8c5520b88edf788c5ede29d","permalink":"https://txzhang.info/project_bak/smartring/","publishdate":"2018-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project_bak/smartring/","section":"project_bak","summary":"I design modularized smart rings and use a thermal imaging smart ring to detect gesture and tag inputs.","tags":null,"title":"Finger Wearables","type":"project_bak"},{"authors":["__Tengxiang Zhang__","Yuanchun Shi","Xin Yi","Yuntao Wang","Chun Yu"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"6f03ae8b88e6902cceb97ed00d760426","permalink":"https://txzhang.info/publication/p_tap2pair_2018/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/p_tap2pair_2018/","section":"publication","summary":"\r","tags":["association"],"title":"Pairing method and wireless device for pairing using wireless signals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuanchun Shi","Yinshuai Zhang","__Tengxiang Zhang__"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"d578c40369efa2d79ca2c24f1c8512cd","permalink":"https://txzhang.info/publication/p_smartring_2018/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/p_smartring_2018/","section":"publication","summary":"\r","tags":["ring"],"title":"Smart Ring and its Wearing Method","type":"publication"},{"authors":["__Tengxiang Zhang__","Xin Yi","Chun Yu","Yuntao Wang","Nicholas Becker","Yuanchun Shi"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1505433600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1505433600,"objectID":"20ec84ffbb02085612bab9405fc95aa7","permalink":"https://txzhang.info/publication/touchpower17/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/touchpower17/","section":"publication","summary":"IMWUT 2017, Discussion Paper TouchPower transfers on-body power to off-body devices during interaction to reduce maintenance demands.","tags":["power","interaction"],"title":"TouchPower: Interaction-based Power Transfer for Power-as-needed Devices","type":"publication"},{"authors":["__Tengxiang Zhang__","Nicholas Becker","Yuntao Wang","Yuan Zhou","Yuanchun Shi"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1495324800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1495324800,"objectID":"cd4c319bab6575b90f2bc537730893df","permalink":"https://txzhang.info/publication/bitid17/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bitid17/","section":"publication","summary":"SmartCom'17, Best Paper Runner-upBitID adds sensing ability to everyday objects in a DIY, low-cost, and maintenance-free manner.","tags":["ultra low-power","RFID","sensing","tag","wireless"],"title":"BitID: Easily Add Battery-free Wireless Sensors to Everyday Objects","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Currently, interactions are typically centered around powerful and independent computing devices. A pervasive interface requires interactive everyday things, which will introduce unacceptable deployment and maintenance efforts. Interconnection techniques reduce such efforts by enabling users to redistribute energy, computation, and I/O resources among computers and everyday things. Only necessary functions like sensing and feedback are kept on the resource-constrained things, while demanding functions like computing and power are offloaded to the resource-abundant computers.\nFigure 1. TouchPower is an Interaction-based Power Transfer (IPT) technique. It transfers DC power through contact between electrodes on the glove and the object. Powering off-body objects with on-body energy sources can significantly reduce user maintenance efforts. I invented the concept of Interaction-based Power Transfer (IPT), which leverages the contact and closeness between user and object during interaction to establish power transfer channel. IPT is especially suitable for devices that only need to be powered during interaction (e.g. mouse, remote controller). The concept was validated with a glove-based IPT prototype TouchPower (Figure 1), which transfers DC power through contacts of electrodes on the glove and objects. With careful design of the transfer interface, energy can be distributed without affecting the original interaction.\nFigure 2. Tap-to-Pair enables wireless device association with minimal resource requirements. I also develop human-centered association techniques to initiate interaction from the more available everyday things. Tap-to-Pair supports spontaneous device association based on temporal correlation of two signals. Users can tap on an IoT device to induce periodic wireless signal strength changes, which is then correlated with the blinking patterns of target devices for association (Figure 7). A follow up work proposes a 2D design space and design guidelines for blinking patterns by applying Bayesian models of user tapping behaviors. Such optimization enables the technique to support robust selection among more targets. A functional Tap-to-Pair application for Linux systems is open sourced on GitHub.\nGo to Sensing Tags\nGo to Finger Wearables\n","date":1493251200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493251200,"objectID":"d984a1cc7a26f321cbdb032f08a1bb7a","permalink":"https://txzhang.info/project_bak/links/","publishdate":"2017-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project_bak/links/","section":"project_bak","summary":"I develop power transfer and cross-device interaction techniques for interactive IoT devices.","tags":null,"title":"Interconnection","type":"project_bak"},{"authors":["Huifeng Ma","Bengeng Cai","__Tengxiang Zhang__","Yan Yang","Weixiang Jiang","Tiejun Cui"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1379203200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1379203200,"objectID":"7bcddcd771de4ca036695306ba0ceaaf","permalink":"https://txzhang.info/publication/metamaterial13/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/metamaterial13/","section":"publication","summary":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation 2013 This paper uses drilled-hole dielectric structures as gradient-index materials.","tags":["metamaterial","antenna"],"title":"Three-dimensional Gradient-index Materials and Their Applications in Microwave Lens Antennas","type":"publication"}]
