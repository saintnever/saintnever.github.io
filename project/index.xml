      <description>&lt;p&gt;Interactive everyday objects are &amp;ldquo;technologies that weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life&amp;rdquo;, which can create an immersive interaction experience. However, users can still distinguish such computing enhanced objects, since they are usually expensive and require extra maintenances (e.g. replace batteries). Users can also be reluctant to replace existing objects for aesthetic or sentimental reasons. To overcome such limitations, I invent passive wireless sensors that can be easily deployed on existing everyday objects. The sensor&amp;rsquo;s many hardware components (e.g. power source, RF oscillator) and computation procedure (e.g. signal digitalization) are offloaded to one remote device. The cost, size, and power consumption of the sensors are then minimized. The small and thin form factor and the passive nature make them suitable for ubiquitous deployment on existing infrastructure and objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./intro.png&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;i&gt;Figure 1. BitID sensors can be easily made (a), registered (b), and deployed (c) on a door to detect intrusion (d).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;source src=&#34;./bitid_room.mp4&#34; type=&#34;video/mp4&#34;&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;BitID&lt;/strong&gt;, I propose to modify commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) low-cost and passive UHF RFID tags to behave as sensors. By attaching shorting stubs to exposed antenna around the chip, the tag’s readability is modulated by the connection status of the shorting stubs. Users can easily make BitID sensors using only copper tape and scissors. When properly deployed, a BitID sensor can detect the binary states of an object. We deploy BitID sensors on six objects in a room to show its high scalability. The codes for the BitID sensing system is open sourced on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/AlexFxw/BitID&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. The RFID reader used in BitID is not widely available yet. So I look into opportunities to leverage more accessible computers (e.g. smart phone, smart ring) to power and compute for the resource-constrained sensors. In &lt;strong&gt;FlexTouch&lt;/strong&gt;, conductive tapes are attached to the touch screen of a smart phone to enable large-scale sensing (e.g. Yoga mat for posture detection). In &lt;strong&gt;ThermalRing&lt;/strong&gt;, I used a smart ring with a low-power thermal camera to recognize passive aluminum stickers for quick access.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Finger Wearables</title>
      <link>https://txzhang.me/project/smartring/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wearable devices are close and readily available to users, which enables a spontaneous and consistent interaction experiences. Finger wearables can support a richer set of input gestures thanks to the dexterity of fingers. Also, they are usually the closet on-body devices to the interacting object, which makes them ideal candidates for resource sharing. However, finger wearables are challenging to design due to size constrains. The small size further limits the available computing, I/O, and power resources, which can impact interaction experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./mring.png&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;i&gt;Figure 1. Users wrap the flexible ring band around the finger and align the magnetic connectors to wear the ring. I/O module are also connected with the main board and battery through the connectors. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome the resource constrains, I explored modular design for a smart ring (Figure 1). Instead of integrating various I/O functions into one piece of hardware, &lt;strong&gt;ModularRing&lt;/strong&gt; uses switchable I/O modules for interaction. The novel wearing design allows the I/O module to be separated from the wireless MCU and battery. Users can then switch the I/O module based on needs, and combine multiple rings with different I/O modules to create advanced interfaces. For example, a ring with a microphone module and a ring with a speaker module can work together as an audio interface. ModularRing won Finalist of 2018 Global Innovation Competition and is open sourced on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/saintnever/ModularRing&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./thermalring.png&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;i&gt;Figure 2. ThermalRing can recognize gestural inputs on flat surfaces and image passive tags by leveraging the heat radiated from hand. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;ThermalRing&lt;/strong&gt;, I proposed a novel I/O module-a low-power low-resolution thermal camera for gesture and tag inputs. ThermalRing analyzes the heat silhouette of the hand to recognize drawing gestures on flat surfaces. I also proposed ThermalTag, passive tags that can be easily made using materials with high heat reflectivity (e.g. copper tape). When covered by hand, ThermalTag reflects the heat radiated from the hand and thus can be imaged. This demonstrates how the on-body wearables can work together with off-body tags for more interaction possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interconnection Techniques</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Currently, most interaction interfaces are designed for powerful and independent computing devices, which adopts a device-centered design approach. A human-centered pervasive interface, however, requires seamless interconnection among devices for resource redistribution. By allocating energy, computation, and interaction resources based on needs, the design of the interfaces can be more flexible and thus truly be woven into the fabric of everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- The power and information interconnections are the underlying infrastructure, on top of which interaction techniques can be implemented.   --&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./touchpower.gif&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;i&gt;Figure 1. TouchPower is an Interaction-based Power Transfer (IPT) technique. It transfers DC power through contact between electrodes on the glove and the object. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power interconnection between few on-body wearables and many off-body objects can significantly reduce user maintenance efforts. I invented the concept of &lt;strong&gt;Interaction-based Power Transfer (IPT)&lt;/strong&gt;, which transfers on-body energy to off-body devices leveraging the contact and close distance between user and object during interaction. IPT is especially suitable for devices that only need to be powered during interaction (e.g. mouse, remote controller). The concept was validated with a glove-based IPT prototype &lt;strong&gt;TouchPower&lt;/strong&gt; (Figure 1), which transfers DC power through contacts of electrodes on the glove and objects. With careful design of the transfer interface, energy can be distributed without affecting the original interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./intro.png&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;i&gt;Figure 2. Tap-to-Pair enables wireless device association with minimal resource requirements. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is challenging to establish information interconnection between resource-constrained IoT devices. &lt;strong&gt;Tap-to-Pair&lt;/strong&gt; provides a spontaneous device association experience based on temporal correlation of two signals. Users can tap the initiating device to induce periodic wireless signal strength changes, which is then correlated with the blinking patterns of target devices for association. In a follow up work, I proposed a 2D design space and design guidelines for blinking patterns by applying Bayesian models of user tapping behaviors. Such optimization enables the technique to support robust selection among more targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go to&lt;/em&gt;
